Er hat uns für Sapa und Halong echt tolle Touren gebucht und uns sehr viele Tipps gegeben. Das Hotel war sehr sauber und das Frühstück war auch gut. Man konnte sich das Frühstück aussuchen (Eierspeise, Pfannkuchen, Müsli...) und seine Frau hat es dann zubereitet. Er hat uns am letzten Tag auch ein günstiges Taxi organisiert, war wirklich angenehm, da  man dort nicht allen Taxifahrern vertrauen kann.   \n",
